        <!-- description here -->
        <p>Requests in this status queue have been submitted by users who have been blocked in ILLiad. This could be the result of graduation or inactivity. It could also be the result of overdue items. After residing in this queue for seven days, if the patron has not taken action to become an active student, obtained alumni privileges, or return overdue items, their requests are deleted.</p>
