        <!-- description here -->
        <p>This status holds requests that have been checked out to the customer. They remain at this status until they are checked in at the Circulation desk.</p>
        <p>To more efficiently manage the renewal process, we place renewals for requests 8 days before their due date in order to have a renewal in process before the renewal reminder email is sent 7 days before the due date. The reminder email is now a fall back in case the renewal requests are not placed.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind placing renewals for all requests is to avoid all the time spent reminding the customer to place a renewal for the item. Essentially patrons will receive notices of new renewed dates until the request is denied renewal and must be returned.</p>
